# The Peg Game

Place a peg in each of the holes of the game board. You'll have one place on the board that won't have a peg. Jump one peg over another to an open space and remove the one that was jumped. Keep doing this until only a single peg remains. If you are successful and leave only one peg, you are a “genius.”
